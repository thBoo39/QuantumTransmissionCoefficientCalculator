Quantum Transmission Coefficient Calculator
-------------------------------------------

Python codes provides a class object to simply calculate quantum mechanical transmission probability across arbitrary potential barriers by using the piece wise constant method. If you have a need to implement quantum tunneling probability across any shape of barriers into your code, it would be helpful.
